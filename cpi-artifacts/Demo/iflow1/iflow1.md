2 Integration Overview
The iflow1 integration scenario is designed to leverage the capabilities of the SAP Cloud Platform Integration platform, enabling the integration of multiple systems and applications. The integration scenario is based on a service-oriented architecture, providing a flexible and scalable solution.

2.1 Integration Architecture
The integration architecture of iflow1 consists of multiple layers, including the presentation layer, application layer, and data access layer. The presentation layer is responsible for interacting with external systems and applications, while the application layer handles business logic and data processing. The data access layer is responsible for accessing and retrieving data from various data sources.

2.2 Integration Components
The iflow1 integration scenario consists of multiple components, including adapters, mappings, and scripts. The adapters are used to connect to external systems and applications, while the mappings are used to transform and convert data between different formats. The scripts are used to implement custom logic and business rules, enabling the integration scenario to meet specific requirements.

3 Integration Scenarios
The iflow1 integration scenario is designed to support multiple integration scenarios, each with its own specific requirements and characteristics. The integration scenarios are designed to facilitate the exchange of data between different systems and applications, enabling business process automation and improved decision making.

3.1 Scenario Description
The iflow1 integration scenario is designed to integrate data from multiple sources, including external systems and applications. The scenario involves the retrieval of data from various sources, transformation and conversion of data into a standardized format, and the loading of data into a target system or application.
