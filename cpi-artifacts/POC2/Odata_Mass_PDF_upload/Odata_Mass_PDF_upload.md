1. Introduction
The iFlow Odata_Mass_PDF_upload is designed to facilitate the mass upload of PDF documents using OData protocols. 
1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this iFlow is to provide a streamlined process for uploading large numbers of PDF documents, leveraging the capabilities of OData for efficient data transfer and handling. 
1.2 Scope
The scope of this iFlow is limited to the upload of PDF documents, and it does not cover other file types or data formats.

2. Integration Overview
This iFlow utilizes a straightforward integration architecture, involving sender and receiver endpoints. 
2.1 Integration Architecture
The integration architecture consists of a sender endpoint, a receiver endpoint, and an integration process that handles the upload of PDF documents. 
2.2 Integration Components
The key components of this iFlow include the sender and receiver endpoints, as well as the integration process that facilitates the upload of PDF documents.

3. Integration Scenarios
The primary scenario for this iFlow involves the mass upload of PDF documents from a sender endpoint to a receiver endpoint. 
3.1 Scenario Description
The scenario begins with the sender endpoint initiating the upload process, followed by the integration process handling the upload of PDF documents to the receiver endpoint. 
3.2 Data Flows
The data flow for this iFlow involves the sender endpoint sending PDF documents to the integration process, which then forwards the documents to the receiver endpoint. 
3.3 Security Requirements
